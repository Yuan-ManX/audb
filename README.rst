**audb** manages your annotated media files.

Databases used in machine learning
should be easily exchangeable
and versioned for reproducibility.
**audb** allows both
as it stores all databases in a `common format`_
and manages different versions of a database.
Databases are stored in repositories
on local file systems
or Artifactory servers.

You can request resampling or remixing of audio content
and filter the downloaded data,
e.g. if you just want to download the test set.

Have a look at the installation_ and quickstart_ instructions.
